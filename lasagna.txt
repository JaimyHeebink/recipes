Ingredients:

1 pound sweet Italian sausage
¾ pound lean ground beef
½ cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
½ cup water
2 tablespoons white sugar
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided
1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves
1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
½ teaspoon fennel seeds
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
12 lasagna noodles
16 ounces ricotta cheese
1 egg
¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese

* Make sure to cover with foil before putting the lasagna in the oven: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
* Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
* Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
